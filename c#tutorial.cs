//TUTORIAL NOTES
//Console: is the container known as a "Class"
//. is the operator that connects a method to a class
//WriteLine() is a method that is found within a class, can be thought of like a function in Python. A method always has () parentheses. 
//Syntax is CaseSensitive and each line ends with a ; to signify the end of the command. Must also use double quotation marks "" unlike Python which can use either if used consistently. 

//Console.Write("") concatonates strings together, a manual space is needed for this to be readible. 
//Console.WriteLine("") outputs the string as requested, and then automatically inserts a new line for the next command.
